# GPT3-Categorize-Twitter-Users
A wrapper with interactive CLI that provides light prompt programming to enable categorizing Twitter users by description content



### Setup

Install pip (if necessary)
```py
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py && python get-pip.py
```
Install the OpenAI library and a CLI helper library
```py
pip install openai inquirer
```

### Usage

You'll need a list of Twitter users exported to CSV with the following headers:
* name
* handle
* description

Start the execution with
```py
python3 gpt_categorize_twitter_users.py.py
```
The rest is done by interactive CLI. 
```text
[?] What is the name of the file you want to read from?: example.csv
[?] What temperature do you want to set for the queries? Range is 0.0-1.0: 0.3
[?] How many samples do you want to manually categorize first? Range is 5-20: 8

[it will then iterate through the number of samples you specify, printing the description and prompting you to label:]

Alec Barrett-Wilsdon (@contextify1) - Opinions about ads, microservices, startups, and oxford commas.\nFormer growth software @curologyusa, SaaS VC @acceleprise, @ucberkeley\nlearnings üëâüèª https://alec.fyi
[?] What categories does this fit in? Separate by commas: ads, ecom, SaaS, VC, tech, etc, etc

[then it will iterate through the full file, saving output to CSV every 25 rows]
```

### Results

I ran 1300 accounts I follow through, sampled 8 random rows with a temperature of 0.3, and used the following 14 tags:
```text
marketing, ads, ecom, growth, VC, retail, engineer, journalist, tech, PE, PM, Shopify, founder, infra
```
Some observations on the results:
* 749 unique tag combinations and 318 unique tags were generated
* 99% of outputs had at least one tag
* 168 tags had only 1 instance
* 247 tags had 5 or less instances
* I manually reviewed tags with 6 or more instances; I removed 10 of 72, 9/10 for being duplicates (e.g. eng and engineer)
* the `founder` tag had the most instances - 24% of total inputs

14 most applied tags by GPT-3 (in order):
```text
founder, PM, journalist, ecom, vc, eng, growth, tech, marketing, PR, med, PE, investor, product
```
10 of inputs were included in the top outputs, 3 derivational (ads=med (media), PM=product, engineer=eng), and one novel one (PR)
